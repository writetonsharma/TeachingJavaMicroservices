This example creates a pom.xml, adds a spring application and one controller.

To do it again, copy this directory and open it inside VS Code.
in the terminal, mvn clean install. This will download all the dependencies reading from the pom.xml. And build the code.
You are ready to run the application.
Right click the application and do run java or debug java.

There are three end points in the controller.
Commands are added to the end points, how to call these end points.

This is how you create a basic controller with getmappings.
