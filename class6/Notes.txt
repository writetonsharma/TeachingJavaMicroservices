install nodejs
install Angular 					- npm install -g @angular/cli
check version 						- ng version
create angular project 				- ng new college-ui
run the project						- npm start
explain 							- index.html, app.html, app.ts, app.css, app.config.ts
explain								- component, service and model

explain								<app-root>
change app-root to ncu-root inside index.html and app.ts
This selector from app.html is loaded into index.html body
change application title to CollegeUI

remove boilerplate code from index.html and add hello world with some css;
So that's how a basic Angular app works.

lets generate a new component
ng generate component components/college
import new component inside app.ts and add to imports section
change app-college to ncu-college
load the new component on home page
try to load the new component from index.html and fix it.
